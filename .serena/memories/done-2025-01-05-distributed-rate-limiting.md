# Distributed Rate Limiting Implementation

## Completed on: 2025-01-05

### What was done:
1. Implemented DistributedRateLimiter with Redis backend
2. Added Circuit Breaker pattern for graceful degradation
3. Created Lua script for atomic Redis operations
4. Built comprehensive test suite
5. Integrated with existing middleware seamlessly
6. Added /metrics endpoint for operational visibility

### Key technical decisions:
- Used go-redis/v9 client library
- Redis Sorted Sets for sliding window implementation
- Circuit breaker with 3 states (closed, open, half-open)
- Automatic fallback to in-memory rate limiter
- Environment-based configuration (REDIS_URL)

### Files created/modified:
- `distributed_ratelimiter.go` - main implementation
- `distributed_ratelimiter_test.go` - test suite
- `ratelimiter.go` - updated for distributed support
- `main.go` - added metrics endpoint
- `go.mod` / `go.sum` - added dependencies

### How to use:
```bash
# With Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379 go run .

# Without Redis (uses in-memory fallback)
go run .

# Check metrics
curl http://localhost:8080/metrics
```

### Test results:
- All tests pass
- Redis integration tests skip when Redis unavailable
- Circuit breaker and fallback scenarios tested
- go vet passes without issues

### Architecture highlights:
- True sliding window with Redis sorted sets
- Atomic operations prevent race conditions
- Automatic recovery when Redis comes back online
- Zero downtime during Redis failures
- Comprehensive metrics for monitoring
