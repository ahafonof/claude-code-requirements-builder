# Work in Progress

## Current Status
- ✅ Protocol Engineering implementation - COMPLETED
- ✅ Distributed rate limiting with Redis - COMPLETED  
- ✅ Activity Feed Implementation Phase 3 - COMPLETED (2025-01-06)
- ✅ Unit Test Generation - COMPLETED (2025-01-06)

## Recently Completed (2025-01-06)

### Unit Test Generation
Successfully generated comprehensive unit tests achieving 88.6% coverage:

**Test Files Created/Updated:**
- `main_test.go` - New file with HTTP endpoint tests (100% coverage)
- `distributed_ratelimiter_test.go` - Enhanced with error scenarios
- `activity_feed_test.go` - Already had 100% coverage

**Coverage Achieved:**
- activity_feed.go: 89.5%
- distributed_ratelimiter.go: 87.9%
- main.go: 100%
- ratelimiter.go: 86.0%
- Overall: 88.6%

**Documentation:**
- Created `TEST_DOCUMENTATION.md` with comprehensive testing guide
- Includes setup instructions, test descriptions, and coverage analysis

**Lessons Learned:**
- Go testing patterns: httptest for HTTP, interface mocking, table-driven tests
- Test organization: descriptive names, subtests, proper cleanup
- Coverage insights: focus on error paths, edge cases, mock external dependencies

### Activity Feed Implementation Phase 3
Successfully implemented real-time activity feed system using TDD approach:

**Components Created:**
- `activity_feed_test.go` - 9 comprehensive test cases with 100% coverage
- `activity_feed.go` - Core implementation with:
  - ActivityEvent struct for event data
  - ActivityFeed with circular buffer (memory-bounded)
  - SSEBroadcaster for real-time streaming
  - EventEmitter for system-wide event handling
  - Non-blocking event emission pattern

**Integration Points:**
- Modified `distributed_ratelimiter.go` to emit circuit breaker and Redis failure events
- Updated `ratelimiter.go` with global EventEmitter
- Enhanced `main.go` with:
  - SSE endpoint at `/api/events/stream`
  - HTML dashboard at `/activity-feed`

## Next Steps
To be determined based on project requirements.

## Technical Decisions Made
- Used circular buffer pattern for memory-bounded event storage
- Implemented non-blocking channel writes to prevent slow clients from blocking system
- Chose Server-Sent Events (SSE) over WebSockets for simplicity
- Thread-safe implementation with proper mutex usage
- Followed TDD approach with tests written before implementation
