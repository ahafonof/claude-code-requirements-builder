# Protocol Engineering Improvement Ideas

## From Research

### 1. Multi-Agent Workflows
```python
# Example: Complex code review with specialized agents
security_agent = Agent(role="Security Reviewer")
performance_agent = Agent(role="Performance Optimizer")
architecture_agent = Agent(role="Architecture Validator")
```

### 2. Protocol Versioning
```markdown
# protocol-engineering-v2.md
Version: 2.0
Breaking changes: [...] 
Migration guide: [...]
```

### 3. Metrics Tracking
Track in memories:
- Time saved per task
- Errors prevented
- Pattern reuse count
- Test coverage trends

### 4. Workflow Orchestration
Consider n8n or similar for visual workflow building

## From Our Testing

### 1. Test Coverage Integration
✅ Added - 100% coverage requirement in Implementation Protocol
✅ Added - Testing Standards section

### 2. Learning Mechanism
Through memories:
- code-patterns - accumulate solutions
- decisions-log - learn from choices
- testing-approach - evolve test strategies

### 3. Session Handoff
Work-in-progress with "See Also" proved effective

## Next Steps
1. Test current protocol thoroughly
2. Add metrics memory after stable
3. Consider multi-agent for v2
4. Keep protocol simple - resist overengineering
