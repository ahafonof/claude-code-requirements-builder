# Activity Feed Implementation Knowledge Capture

## Overview
Implemented a real-time activity monitoring system for the rate limiter using Server-Sent Events (SSE) and circular buffer pattern.

## Key Design Patterns

### 1. Circular Buffer for Event Storage
```go
type ActivityFeed struct {
    events []*ActivityEvent
    head   int
    size   int
    mu     sync.RWMutex
}
```
- Fixed-size buffer prevents unbounded memory growth
- O(1) insertion, efficient for high-throughput systems
- Thread-safe with RWMutex for concurrent access

### 2. Non-Blocking Event Emission
```go
select {
case client.Events <- event:
    // Event sent successfully
default:
    // Channel full, skip this client (non-blocking)
}
```
- Prevents slow/disconnected clients from blocking the system
- Uses buffered channels with select/default pattern
- Maintains system responsiveness under load

### 3. Event Types
- `rate_limit_rejected` - When request exceeds rate limit
- `circuit_breaker_state_change` - Circuit breaker state transitions
- `redis_failure` - Redis operation failures

## Integration Points

### Rate Limiter Integration
```go
if !allowed && globalEventEmitter != nil {
    globalEventEmitter.EmitRateLimitRejection(r)
}
```

### Circuit Breaker Integration
```go
if eventEmitter != nil && oldState != StateOpen {
    eventEmitter.EmitCircuitBreakerStateChange(
        stateNames[oldState], 
        stateNames[StateOpen], 
        cb.failures
    )
}
```

## SSE Implementation Details
- Headers: `Content-Type: text/event-stream`, `Cache-Control: no-cache`
- Event format: `data: {json}\n\n`
- Automatic reconnection in JavaScript client
- Initial event replay from circular buffer

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component (100% coverage)
- Concurrency tests with multiple goroutines
- Non-blocking behavior verification
- Integration tests with HTTP handlers

## Performance Considerations
- Circular buffer size: 1000 events (configurable)
- Client event buffer: 100 events
- Non-blocking writes prevent system degradation
- Efficient mutex usage (RWMutex for reads)

## Gotchas & Solutions
1. **String literals with newlines in Go**: Use `\n\n` instead of actual newlines
2. **Duplicate function definitions**: Keep utility functions in one place
3. **EventEmitter parameter**: Pass nil for tests, globalEventEmitter for production
4. **Client cleanup**: Always defer Unsubscribe to prevent memory leaks

## Future Enhancements
- Event filtering by type
- Persistent event storage
- Event aggregation/statistics
- WebSocket support as alternative to SSE
- Event replay with timestamp ranges
