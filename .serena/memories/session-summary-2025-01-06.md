# Session Summary - 2025-01-06

## Completed Work

### 1. Protocol Engineering Implementation
- Created comprehensive protocol in .claude/protocol-engineering.md
- 6 core protocols: Startup, Understanding, Implementation, Code Review, Debugging, Knowledge Capture
- Enforced TDD with 100% test coverage requirement
- Session continuity through work-in-progress memory

### 2. Distributed Rate Limiting 
- Fully implemented with Redis support
- Circuit breaker pattern for fallback
- Lua scripts for atomic operations
- Comprehensive test suite
- Files: distributed_ratelimiter.go, distributed_ratelimiter_test.go

### 3. Requirements Integration
- Tested requirements-builder → Protocol Engineering workflow
- Created activity feed requirements (Phase 1-2 complete)
- Optimized protocol for different task complexities
- Best practices research documented

### 4. Knowledge Base
- 30+ Serena memories created
- Full documentation of approach
- Research validation from industry
- Implementation patterns saved

## Next Session Tasks

### Activity Feed Implementation (Phase 3)
Command: "Активуй проєкт, продовжуй activity feed - напиши тести"

Expected:
1. Create activity_feed_test.go with 6 test cases
2. Run tests (all should fail initially)
3. Update work-in-progress

### Future Work
- Complete activity feed implementation
- Test protocol with more complex features
- Consider multi-agent workflows
- Create protocol v2 with metrics

## Repository Status
- Commit: cfa7017 "Implement Protocol Engineering and distributed rate limiting"
- Pushed to: origin/main
- All work saved and documented
