# Discovery Questions

Based on the codebase analysis, here are the five most important yes/no questions to understand the code reduction requirements:

## Q1: Do you want to maintain all current functionality (rate limiting, activity feed, API endpoints)?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (removing features without confirmation would break existing users)

## Q2: Should the code reduction focus on removing duplication between local and distributed rate limiters?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (there's significant overlap between ratelimiter.go and distributed_ratelimiter.go)

## Q3: Is it acceptable to introduce abstractions/interfaces to reduce code repetition?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (common Go practice for clean architecture)

## Q4: Should we preserve the current API structure and endpoints?
**Default if unknown:** Yes (changing APIs would break compatibility)

## Q5: Can we consolidate test files if it improves code organization?
**Default if unknown:** No (separate test files per component is Go best practice)
